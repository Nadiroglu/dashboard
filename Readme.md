# FlatEvent and Event Ticketing Website

Think about a social media page where there people who likes the same sports club as you do and i did it by using React for the frontend and Flask for the backend.

## Overview

The application allows users to browse fan clubs and make requests to join them. Each fan club is created by a user, who becomes the admin of that club. Admins have access to a special admin dashboard.
After a user's request is accepted by the admin, they become a member of the club and can join the community.
They can follow new people, get to know others, arrange meetings, engage in live chats, and connect with millions of people worldwide.
Each User has their Hashed and Saved, login information.
